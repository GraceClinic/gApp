Every version install of PHPstorm is different.  For version 8.0.4, these templates resided in the following location:  C:\Users\jderouen.GRACESUPPORT\.WebIde80\config\fileTemplates.  To import to your specific version, find out where your PhpStorm "config" directory resides and place these files within that location.  Afterwards, you will need to restart PhpStorm so that it reads these templates and makes them available for usage.
