Every version install of PHPstorm is different.  For version 8.0.4, these templates resided in the following location:  C:\Users\jderouen.GRACESUPPORT\.WebIde80\config\templates.  To import to your specific version, find out where your PhpStorm "config" directory resides and place these files within the proper location therein.  Afterwards, you will need to restart PhpStorm so that it reads these Live Templates and makes them available for usage.  **Note** this is an XML file that may be specific to the PhpStorm versus, this straight copy method may not work across PhpStorm versions.
